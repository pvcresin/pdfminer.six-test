ABSTRACT 
UPDATED—13  February  2015.  This  sample  paper 
describes 
for  SIGCHI 
conference  proceedings,  and  offers  recommendations  on 
writing  for  the  worldwide  SIGCHI  readership.  Please 
review  this  document  even  if  you  have  submitted  to 
SIGCHI  conferences  before,  as  some  format  details  have 
changed  relative  to  previous  years.  Abstracts  should  be 
about 150 words and are required. 
Author Keywords 
Authors’  choice;  of  terms;  separated;  by  semicolons; 
commas, within terms only; this section is required.  
ACM Classification Keywords 
H.5.m. Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI): 
Miscellaneous;  See  http://acm.org/about/class/1998  for  the 
full list of ACM classifiers. This section is required. 
INTRODUCTION 
This format is to be used for submissions that are published 
in the conference proceedings. We wish to give this volume 
a consistent, high-quality appearance. We therefore ask that 
authors follow some simple guidelines. You should format 
your paper exactly  like this  document. The  easiest  way  to 
do this is to replace the content with your own material.  
This document describes how to prepare your submissions 
using Microsoft Word on a PC or Mac. Specific instructions 
about accessing menu items in Word refer to the PC version 
of Word 2013. 
PAGE SIZE AND COLUMNS 
On each page your material should fit within a rectangle of 
7  x  9.25  in  (18  x  23.5  cm),  centered  on  a  US  letter  page 
(8.5x11 in), beginning 0.75 in (1.9 cm) from the top of the 
page,  with  a  0.33  in  (0.85  cm)  space  between  two  3.3  in 
(8.4  cm)  columns.  Right  margins  should  be  justified,  not 
ragged.  Please  be  sure  your  document  and  PDF  are  US 
letter and not A4. 

Paste the appropriate copyright/license statement here. ACM now supports 
three different publication options: 

• ACM copyright: ACM holds the copyright on the work. This is the 

historical approach. 

• License:  The  author(s)  retain  copyright,  but  ACM  receives  an 

exclusive publication license. 

• Open  Access:  The  author(s)  wish  to  pay  for  the  work  to  be  open 

access. The additional fee must be paid to ACM. 

This  text  field  is  large  enough  to hold  the  appropriate  release  statement 
assuming it is single-spaced in Times New Roman 8-point font. Please do 
not change or modify the size of this text box. 
Each submission will be assigned a DOI string to be included here. 

the  default  styles 

TYPESET TEXT 
The styles contained in this document have been modified 
from 
to  reflect  ACM  formatting 
conventions. For example, content paragraphs like this one 
are formatted using the Normal style. 
Title and Authors 
Your  paper’s  title,  authors,  and  affiliations  should  run 
across  the  full  width  of  the  page  in  a  single  column  7  in 
(17.8  cm)  wide.  The  title  should  be  in  Helvetica  or  Arial 
18-point bold (the Title style in this document). Authors’ 
names  should  be  in  Times  New  Roman  or  Times  Roman 
12-point bold (Author Name style), and affiliations in the 
font as 12-point regular (Author Affiliation style). 
To  position  names  and  addresses,  use  a  single-row  table 
with invisible borders, as in this document. Alternatively, if 
only one address is needed, use a centered tab stop to center 
all  name  and  address  text  on  the  page;  for  two  addresses, 
use two centered tab stops, and so on. For more than three 
authors, you may have to place some address information in 
a footnote, or in a named section at the end of your paper. 
Leave one 10-point line of white space below the last line 
of affiliations.  
Adding and Removing Author Fields Above 
If  you  need  a  4th  block  for  an  additional  author  with  a 
different affiliation, click on the table, click “layout” under 
“table tools”, and click “insert left” or “insert right”. Then 
right-click anywhere on the table, click “Table Properties”, 
and within the “Table” tab, click the tab box for “Preferred 
Width” and enter “7”. 
If  you  need  author  blocks  for  only  1  or  2  authors,  you 
should  remove  one  column  from  the  table.  Right-click  in 
the unwanted cell, click “Delete Cell”, click “Delete entire 
column”, then click “OK”. Repeat if necessary. 
Abstract and Keywords 
Every  submission  should  begin  with  an  abstract  of  about 
150 words, followed by a set of keywords. The abstract and 
keywords  should  be  placed  in  the  left  column  of  the  first 
page under the left half of the title. The abstract should be a 
concise 
the  problem,  approach,  and 
conclusions  of  the  work  described.  It  should  clearly  state 
the paper’s contribution to the field of HCI. 
Normal or Body Text 
Please  use  10-point  Times  New  Roman  or  Times  Roman 
font  (the  Normal  style)  or,  if  this  is  unavailable,  another 
proportional  font  with  serifs,  as  close  as  possible  in 
appearance  to  Times  New  Roman  10-point.  Other  than 

statement  of 

Helvetica  or  Arial  headings,  please  use  sans-serif  or  non-
proportional fonts only for special purposes, such as source 
code text. 
First Page Copyright Notice 
This sample word document has the correct ACM SIGCHI 
copyright notice in place (see page 1, bottom of column 1). 
Accepted  papers  will  be  distributed  in  the  conference 
publications. They will also be placed in the ACM Digital 
Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of 
researchers and practitioners worldwide. ACM’s copyright 
and permissions policy is here: 
http://acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy 
Subsequent Pages 
On pages beyond the first, start at the top of the page and 
continue in double-column format. The two columns on the 
last page should be of approximately equal length. 

 

Figure 1. Use high-resolution images, 300+ dpi, legible if 

printed in color or black-and-white. Number all figures and 

include captions below, using Insert, Caption. 

References and Citations 
Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, 
ordered  alphabetically  by  last  name  of  first  author,  and 
referenced by numbers in brackets [1,3,4].

Table 1. Table captions should be placed below the table. We 
recommend table lines be 1 point, 25% black. Minimize use of 

unnecessary table lines. 

Your references should be published materials accessible to 
the  public.  Internal  technical  reports  may  be  cited  only  if 
they are easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for 
obtaining  the  report  within  your  citation)  and  may  be 
obtained  by  any  reader  for  a  nominal  fee.  Proprietary 
information  may  not  be  cited.  Private  communications 
should  be  acknowledged  in  the  main  text,  not  referenced 
(e.g., “[Borriello, personal communication]”).

includes  citations  to  internet  resources  [1,4,8,1]  according 
to ACM format, although it is often appropriate to include 
URLs directly in the text, as above. 
SECTIONS 
The heading of a section should be in Arial 9-point bold, all 
in  capitals  (Heading  1  style).  Sections  should  not  be 
numbered.  
Subsections 
Headings  of  subsections  should  be  in  Arial  9-point  bold 
with initial letters capitalized (Heading 2 style). For sub-
sections  and  sub-subsections,  a  word  like  the  or  of  is  not 
capitalized unless it is the first word of the heading. 
Sub-subsections 
Headings  for  sub-subsections  should  be  in  Arial  9-point 
italic with initial letters capitalized (Heading 3 style).  
FIGURES/CAPTIONS 
Place  figures  and  tables  at  the  top  or  bottom  of  the 
appropriate  column  or  columns,  on  the  same  page  as  the 
relevant  text  (see  Figure  1).  A  figure  or  table  may  extend 
across both columns to a maximum width of two columns, 
or 17.78 cm (7 in.). 
Captions  should  be  Times  New  Roman  9-point  bold 
(Caption style). They should be numbered (e.g., “Table 1” 
or  “Figure  2”),  centered,  and  placed  beneath  the  figure  or 
table.  The  words  “Figure”  and  “Table”  should  be  spelled 
out (e.g., “Figure” rather than “Fig.”) wherever they occur. 
All  figures  should  also  include  alt  text  for  improved 
accessibility.  In  Word,  right  click  the  figure,  and  select 
Format Picture | Layout | Alt Text). Papers and notes may 
use color figures, which are included in the page limit; the 
figures must be usable when printed in black-and-white in 
the proceedings. 
The paper may be accompanied by a short video figure up 
to five minutes in length. However, the paper should stand 
on its own without the video figure, as the video may not be 
available to everyone who reads the paper. 
Inserting Images 
Occasionally  MS  Word  generates  larger-than-necessary 
PDF  files  when  images  inserted  into  the  document  are 
manipulated  in  MS  Word.  To  minimize  this  problem,  use 
an image editing tool to resize the image at the appropriate 
printing  resolution  (usually  300  dpi),  and  then  insert  the 
image into Word using Insert | Picture | From File. 

Figure 2. Sample of a wide figure. Be sure to place at the top or bottom of the page. Ensure that important information is legible in 

both black-and-white and color printing. Image: CC-BY-ND ayman on Flickr. 

 

Table Style 
The text of tables will format better if you use the Table 
Text style (as in Table 1). If you do not use this style, then you 

may want to adjust the vertical spacing of the text in the 
tables. To adjust the spacing of text in a table in Word, use 
Home | Paragraph | Indents and Spacing. Generally, text in 
each field of a table will look better if it has equal amounts of 

spacing above and below it, as in Table 1. Table captions 

should be placed below the table. We recommend table lines 
be 1 point, 25% black. Minimize use of unnecessary table 

lines. 

For improved accessibility, header rows of tables should be 
marked. In Word, right-click a header row, and select Table 
Properties | Row | Repeat as header… 
LANGUAGE, STYLE AND CONTENT 
The  written  and  spoken  language  of  SIGCHI  is  English. 
Spelling  and  punctuation  may  use  any  dialect  of  English 
(e.g.,  British,  Canadian,  US,  etc.)  provided  this  is  done 
consistently. Hyphenation is optional. To ensure suitability 
for an international audience, please: 
•  Write in a straightforward style.  
•  Try to avoid long or complex sentence structures.  
•  Use  common  and  basic  vocabulary  (e.g.,  use  the  word 

“unusual” rather than the word “arcane”). 

•  Briefly define or explain all technical terms that may be 

unfamiliar to readers. 

•  Explain all acronyms the first time they are used in your 

text—e.g., “Digital Signal Processing (DSP)”. 

•  Explain  local  references  (e.g.,  not  everyone  knows  all 

city names in a particular country). 

•  Explain  “insider”  comments.  Ensure  that  your  whole 
audience understands any reference whose meaning you 
do  not  describe  (e.g.,  do  not  assume  that  everyone  has 
used an Android phone, or a particular application). 

•  Explain  colloquial  language  and  puns.  Understanding 
phrases like “red herring” may require a local knowledge 
of English. Humor and irony are difficult to translate. 

•  Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, 
such as times, dates, currencies, and numbers (e.g., “1-5- 
97”  or  “5/1/97”  may  mean  5  January  or  1  May,  and 
“seven  o’clock”  may  mean  7:00  am  or  19:00).  For 
currencies, indicate equivalences: “Participants were paid 
₩22, or roughly US$29.” 

•  Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, 
she)  and  other  gendered  words  (chairman,  manpower, 
man-months).  Use  inclusive  language  that  is  gender-
neutral (e.g., she or he, they, s/he, chair, staff, staff-hours, 
person-years). See the Guidelines for Bias-Free Writing 
for  further  advice  and  examples  regarding  gender  and 
other  personal  attributes  [9].  Be  particularly  aware  of 
considerations  around  writing  about  people  with 
disabilities.  

•  If  possible,  use  the  full  (extended)  alphabetic  character 
set  for  names  of  persons,  institutions,  and  places  (e.g., 
Grønbæk,  Lafreniére,  Sánchez,  Nguyễn,  Universität, 
Weißenbach, Züllighoven, Århus, etc.). These characters 
are  already  included  in  most  versions  and  variants  of 
Times, Helvetica, and Arial fonts.

ACCESSIBILITY 
The  Executive  Council  of  SIGCHI  has  committed  to 
making  SIGCHI 
for 
researchers,  practitioners,  and  educators  with  disabilities. 
As a part of this goal, the all authors are asked to work on 
improving 
submissions. 
Specifically,  we  encourage  authors  to  carry  out  the 
following five steps: 
1. Add alternative text to all figures 
2. Mark table headings 
3. Generate a tagged PDF 
4. Verify the default language 
5. Set the tab order to “Use Document Structure”

PAGE NUMBERING, HEADERS, AND FOOTERS 
Your final submission should not contain footer or header 
information at the top or bottom of each page. Specifically, 
your  final  submission  should  not  include  page  numbers. 
Initial  submissions  may  include  page  numbers,  but  these 
must  be  removed  for  camera-ready.  Page  numbers  will  be 
added to the PDF when the proceedings are assembled. 
PRODUCING AND TESTING PDF FILES 
We  recommend  that  you  produce  a  PDF  version  of  your 
submission  well  before  the  final  deadline.  Your  PDF  file 
must  be  ACM  DL  Compliant.  The  requirements  for  an 
ACM Compliant PDF are available at: 
http://sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-
settings.htm 
When  creating  your  PDF  from  Word,  ensure  that  you 
generate  a  tagged  PDF  from  improved  accessibility.  This 
can  be  done  by  using  the  Adobe  PDF  add-in,  also  called 
PDFMaker.  Select  Acrobat  |  Preferences  from  the  ribbon 
and  ensure  that  “Enable  Accessibility  and  Reflow  with 
tagged  Adobe  PDF”  is  selected.  You  can  then  generate  a 
tagged  PDF  by  selecting  “Create  PDF”  from  the  Acrobat 
ribbon. Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the 
same  software  the  publisher  will  use,  Adobe  Acrobat 
Reader  Version  10,  which  is  widely  available  at  no  cost. 
Note 
a  North 
American/European  version  of  Acrobat  Reader,  so  please 
check your PDF accordingly.  
CONCLUSION 
It  is  important  that  you  write  for  the  SIGCHI  audience. 
Please  read  previous  years’  proceedings  to  understand  the 
writing style and conventions that successful authors have 
used.  State  clearly  what  you  have  done,  not  merely  what 
you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from 
previously published work, i.e., the unique contribution that 
your  work  makes  to  the  field.  Please  consider  what  the 
reader will learn from your submission, and how they will 
find your work useful. If you write with these questions in 
mind,  your  work  is  more  likely  to  be  successful,  both  in 
being accepted into the conference, and in influencing the 
work of our field.
